8. Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays of integers.
9. Write a Java program to remove duplicate elements from an array.
10. Write a Java program to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers.

2. Write a Java program to segregate all 0s on the left side and all 1s on the right side of a given
array of 0s and 1s.
3. Write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers of an array, in the sorted array the
value of the first element should be maximum, second value should be minimum value, third
should be second maximum, fourth second be second minimum and so on

6. Write a Java program to convert an array to ArrayList.
7. Write your own POJO class with 5 properties with default values. Your POJO class should have proper(access specifiers) setter & getter methods. Create an object for the same from the main method. You have to print that object alone & it should print all the properties of the object.
8. Write your own class with at least 3 overloaded constructors. From the main method create each object using those constructors.
9. Define an Enum for the rainbow colors, with values(color code) ranging from 1 to 7. Print the color and its corresponding color code from the main method..
